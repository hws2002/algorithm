# LAB : Comparison of Time complexity of different Algorithms on Partial Sum Problem
## 1. Introduction
### 1.1. Purpose of this lab
- To understand and compare the time complexity of different algorithms
- To understand the importance of time complexity
- To understand the concept of amortized time complexity
### 1.2. What is time complexity?

### 1.2.1 Amortized Time Complexity

### 1.3. How to measure time complexity
- Counting the number of loops
- Counting the number of operations

## 2. Task
Write 4 different algorithms that finds the largest partial sum of an array of integers.  
And compare the time complexity of each algorithm.
- The array is given as an input (input/array.txt file)
- All the values in the array are integers from -100 to 100
- The sizes of the arrays are 100, 1000, 10000. Each size has 100, 10, 1 arrays.
