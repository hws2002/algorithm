# 2. Task
Write different sorting algorithms and compare the time complexity of each algorithm.
- The array is given as an input (input/array.txt file)
- All the values in the array are integers from -100 to 100
- The sizes of the arrays are 100, 1000, 10000. Each size has 100, 10, 1 arrays.
- The output should be the sorted array and the time taken to sort the array.
- The output should be written in output/output.txt file.
- The output should be in the following format.
```
size: 100
array: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
time: 0.0001
```

## 3. How to submit
- Submit the source code of the 4 sorting algorithms.
- Submit the source code of the main function.
